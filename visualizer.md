# OssC Visualizer Redesign: Metaballs Approach

## Overview
Redesign the OssC (Oscilloscope) visualizer using metaballs to create a seamless, organic audio-responsive visualization that eliminates the current path closure issues and jutting artifacts.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Modularization
- **Extract OssC from index.html** â†’ Create dedicated `oscilloscope.js` tool
- **Follow existing patterns** â†’ `OscilloscopeTool extends AudioToolBase` 
- **Integration** â†’ Plug into existing tool ecosystem alongside ambient-sounds, timer, etc.

### 2. Metaballs Visualization System

#### Core Concept
- **Ring of metaballs** â†’ 8-16 metaballs positioned in a circular arrangement
- **Frequency mapping** â†’ Each metaball assigned specific frequency range from audio data
- **Dynamic sizing** â†’ Metaball radius/influence varies based on frequency amplitude
- **Seamless edges** â†’ Only draw outline where metaballs don't touch neighboring balls

#### Technical Implementation
```
Metaball Ring Layout:
- Position metaballs evenly around circle (360Â° / num_balls)
- Each metaball gets frequency range: frequencies[i * range_size : (i+1) * range_size]
- Metaball influence radius = base_radius + (frequency_amplitude * scale_factor)
```

#### Rendering Strategy
1. **Calculate metaball field** â†’ Generate influence field for all metaballs
2. **Find edge contours** â†’ Identify outline where field strength = threshold
3. **Mask breathing circles** â†’ Use metaball shapes as clipping masks for background
4. **Draw outline only** â†’ Render edge contours where balls don't overlap

### 3. Frequency Data Integration

#### Mapping Strategy
- **Low frequencies** (0-64) â†’ Larger metaballs for bass response
- **Mid frequencies** (65-128) â†’ Medium metaballs for vocals/instruments  
- **High frequencies** (129-192) â†’ Smaller metaballs for treble details
- **Ultra-high** (193-256) â†’ Micro metaballs for sparkle/detail

#### Audio Source Compatibility
- **Ambient sounds** â†’ Natural organic shapes from environmental audio
- **Focus sounds** â†’ Synthetic patterns from white/pink/brown noise
- **Microphone** â†’ Real-time response to user environment
- **Demo mode** â†’ Smooth synthetic metaball animation

## Benefits of Metaballs Approach

### Solves Current Issues
âœ… **No path closure problems** â†’ Mathematically continuous surfaces  
âœ… **No jutting artifacts** â†’ Smooth mathematical blending  
âœ… **Complete circle coverage** â†’ Multiple balls ensure full perimeter  
âœ… **Organic visualization** â†’ Natural, flowing audio representation  

### Enhanced Features
ðŸŽ¯ **Accurate frequency representation** â†’ Each ball = specific frequency range  
ðŸŽ¯ **Seamless integration** â†’ Metaballs as masks for existing breathing circles  
ðŸŽ¯ **Scalable complexity** â†’ Easy to adjust number of balls for performance  
ðŸŽ¯ **Modular architecture** â†’ Clean separation from main application logic  

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Modularization
- Extract oscilloscope logic from index.html
- Create OscilloscopeTool class structure
- Integrate with existing tool system

### Phase 2: Metaballs Engine
- Implement vanilla JS metaballs calculation
- Create efficient field generation algorithm
- Develop edge contour detection

### Phase 3: Audio Integration
- Map frequency data to metaball properties
- Implement real-time updates
- Connect to existing audio analysis pipeline

### Phase 4: Visual Integration
- Use metaballs as clipping masks for breathing circles
- Render outline contours
- Fine-tune visual aesthetics

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- **Efficient field calculation** â†’ Pre-compute where possible
- **Canvas optimization** â†’ Use appropriate drawing methods
- **Frame rate target** â†’ Maintain 60fps visualization

### Customization
- **Adjustable metaball count** â†’ 8-16 balls based on performance
- **Frequency range tuning** â†’ Configurable frequency-to-ball mapping
- **Visual parameters** â†’ Customizable influence radius, threshold values

### Compatibility
- **Cross-browser** â†’ Vanilla JS for maximum compatibility
- **Responsive** â†’ Adapt to different canvas sizes
- **Audio source agnostic** â†’ Work with any frequency data source

## Expected Outcome
A seamless, organic oscilloscope visualization that:
- Displays real audio frequency data as smooth, flowing shapes
- Eliminates all current visual artifacts and edge issues
- Integrates naturally with existing breathing circle aesthetics
- Provides modular, maintainable code architecture
- Delivers consistent 60fps performance across audio sources
