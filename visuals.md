# OssC Visualizer Redesign: Interactive Metaballs Goo

## Overview
Transform the OssC (Oscilloscope) visualizer into an interactive metaballs-based "goo creature" that serves as a digital companion. The metaballs approach eliminates current path closure issues while adding personality, emotes, and thought bubbles to create an engaging, organic audio-responsive assistant with fluid, blob-like behavior.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Modularization
- **Extract OssC from index.html** â†’ Create dedicated `oscilloscope.js` tool
- **Follow existing patterns** â†’ `OscilloscopeTool extends AudioToolBase` 
- **Integration** â†’ Plug into existing tool ecosystem alongside ambient-sounds, timer, etc.

### 2. Interactive Metaballs System

#### Boundary Container
- **Square boundary area** â†’ Defined container that constrains the goo creature's movement
- **Collision physics** â†’ Metaballs bounce/squish against container edges
- **Responsive sizing** â†’ Container scales with canvas size while maintaining aspect ratio

#### Core Metaballs Concept
- **Dynamic blob cluster** â†’ 6-12 metaballs that form a cohesive goo creature
- **Frequency mapping** â†’ Each metaball assigned specific frequency range from audio data
- **Dynamic sizing** â†’ Metaball radius/influence varies based on frequency amplitude
- **Seamless edges** â†’ Organic blob shape with smooth mathematical blending

#### Technical Implementation
```
Boundary Container:
- Square container centered in canvas
- Container size = min(canvas.width, canvas.height) * 0.8
- Physics bounds for metaball collision detection
- Visual border (optional, toggleable)

Metaball Cluster Layout:
- Position metaballs in organic cluster formation (not rigid circle)
- Each metaball gets frequency range: frequencies[i * range_size : (i+1) * range_size]  
- Metaball influence radius = base_radius + (frequency_amplitude * scale_factor)
- Center of mass moves within container bounds
```

#### Interactive Features
1. **Emotional States** â†’ Different metaball arrangements for happy, calm, excited, focused
2. **Thought Bubbles** â†’ Small bubble cluster that appears above main goo with status text
3. **Emote Animations** â†’ Temporary shape changes (bounce, stretch, wiggle) triggered by events
4. **Container Physics** â†’ Goo squishes against boundaries, maintaining volume conservation

#### Rendering Strategy
1. **Calculate metaball field** â†’ Generate influence field for all metaballs within boundary
2. **Apply container constraints** â†’ Ensure goo shape stays within bounds
3. **Find edge contours** â†’ Identify outline where field strength = threshold
4. **Render interactive elements** â†’ Draw thought bubbles, emote effects
5. **Apply breathing effects** â†’ Use metaball shapes as clipping masks for background gradients

### 3. Goo Creature Behaviors

#### Emotional States & Triggers
- **Happy** â†’ Timer completed successfully, todo items checked off
- **Focused** â†’ Timer running, high productivity metrics
- **Calm** â†’ Ambient sounds active, steady breathing pattern
- **Excited** â†’ Music playing, high audio activity
- **Sleepy** â†’ Low audio activity for extended period
- **Bouncy** â†’ User interaction detected (clicks, setting changes)

#### Thought Bubble System
- **Status Messages** â†’ Current activity, motivational quotes, reminders
- **Bubble Positioning** â†’ Always above goo creature, within container bounds
- **Auto-Hide Logic** â†’ Fade out after 3-5 seconds unless important
- **Priority System** â†’ Important messages (timer alerts) override routine status

#### Emote Animation Library
- **Bounce** â†’ Vertical squish and stretch cycle
- **Wiggle** â†’ Side-to-side sway with metaball oscillation  
- **Pulse** â†’ Radial expansion/contraction synchronized with breathing
- **Stretch** â†’ Horizontal elongation when "reaching" for something
- **Squish** â†’ Compress against container walls when "excited"

### 4. Frequency Data Integration

#### Mapping Strategy
- **Low frequencies** (0-64) â†’ Larger metaballs for bass response, affects overall goo mass
- **Mid frequencies** (65-128) â†’ Medium metaballs for vocals/instruments, drives emotional state
- **High frequencies** (129-192) â†’ Smaller metaballs for treble details, creates surface texture
- **Ultra-high** (193-256) â†’ Micro metaballs for sparkle/detail, adds movement energy

#### Audio Source Compatibility
- **Ambient sounds** â†’ Calm, flowing organic shapes
- **Focus sounds** â†’ Steady, rhythmic patterns that promote concentration
- **Microphone** â†’ Real-time environmental response
- **Demo mode** â†’ Playful, attention-getting synthetic animation

## Benefits of Metaballs Approach

### Solves Current Issues
âœ… **No path closure problems** â†’ Mathematically continuous surfaces  
âœ… **No jutting artifacts** â†’ Smooth mathematical blending
